# Fix small khmer font for Windows 10/11

## What you need **INSTALL FOR ALL USERS**
Use the fonts from the static folder for best reults!
- Noto Sans Khmer https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Khmer
- Noto Serif Khmer https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif+Khmer


## Why do this?
As you may have expereinced the default Khmer font installed by Windows 10/11 doesn't scale with many modern UIs like Telegram.

## Steps
Download the .reg file and open it, click Yes to confirm then restart your computer.

## Current draw backs 
- ~~Browsers not selecting the right fallback font~~ Install fonts for **All users**

  - I would advise against this one, many old windows programs, *cough* Nvidia Control Panel *cough* cannot scale correctly with Khmer Unicode width. This cause some content to be out of bounds and windows will not scroll correctly
